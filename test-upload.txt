This is a test file for the Universal MCP Server Phase 2 implementation.

The new file management tools include:
1. file-upload - Upload local files to OpenAI
2. file-list - List all uploaded files
3. file-get - Get file details
4. file-delete - Delete files
5. file-content - Download file content
6. upload-create - Create multipart uploads for large files

This completes the end-to-end workflow:
Upload file → Add to vector store → Search and retrieve

Phase 2 successfully transforms the MCP server from "vector store management only" to "complete file-to-vector-store workflow" that users need in real-world scenarios.
