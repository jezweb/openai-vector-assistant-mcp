## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-30

### 🚀 Phase 2: Complete File-to-Vector-Store Workflow

**MAJOR MILESTONE**: Transform from "vector store management only" to "complete file-to-vector-store workflow" - solving real-world scenarios like processing 470 PDF files directly from your local filesystem.

#### 🌟 Major Features - File Upload & Management

##### Added
- **Complete End-to-End Workflow**: Transform from "vector store management only" to "complete file-to-vector-store workflow"
- **File Upload Capabilities**: Direct file upload from local filesystem to OpenAI

#### 🛠️ New File Management Tools (6 New Tools)

##### Core File Operations
- `file-upload` - Upload local files directly to OpenAI (CRITICAL - solves the missing piece)
- `file-list` - List all uploaded files with filtering and pagination
- `file-get` - Get detailed information about specific files
- `file-delete` - Remove files from OpenAI storage
- `file-content` - Download and retrieve file content
- `upload-create` - Create multipart uploads for large files (>25MB)

#### 📈 Workflow Improvements

##### Before Phase 2 (Vector Store Management Only)
```
User has files → [MANUAL UPLOAD TO OPENAI] → Use vector store tools
❌ Broken workflow - users had to manually upload files first
```

##### After Phase 2 (Complete Workflow)
```
User has files → file-upload → vector-store-file-add → Complete workflow
✅ Seamless end-to-end experience
```

##### Real-World Usage Examples
1. **Document Processing**: Upload PDFs → Add to vector store → Query documents
2. **Code Analysis**: Upload source files → Create vector store → Search codebase
3. **Knowledge Base**: Upload documentation → Build searchable knowledge base
4. **Content Management**: Upload articles → Organize in vector stores → Semantic search
5. **Bulk Processing**: Upload 470 PDF files → Batch add to vector store → Search entire collection
